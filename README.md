# Bayesian Signal Extraction Using MCMC

This project demonstrates Bayesian inference techniques for signal extraction in high-energy physics data using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling.

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
To perform parameter estimation of a double Gaussian peak over a linear Chebyshev background using MCMC and visualize the posterior distributions.

---

## ðŸ§ª Problem Description

In many particle physics experiments, signal peaks are superimposed on complex backgrounds. This project models a dataset composed of:

- Two **Gaussian peaks** representing signal processes
- A **Chebyshev polynomial** representing the background

The goal is to accurately estimate the parameters (means, widths, amplitudes, background coefficients) using **Bayesian inference**.
